## Setup and Dependencies

To get started, simply clone this repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cojomojo/a2cloud.git
```

To utilize the PERF engine (to extract application features), you must:

* Have [Linux perf tools](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) installed
* Have a supported version of [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed
* Be on an x86_64 architecture (for now)

To utilize the cloud trace engine (to extract cloud instance features), you must:

* Have gfortran installed
* Have superuser privileges on the instance in question

## How to Use

To generate a application feature vector, utilize the PERF engine. The PERF engine can be used to extract features of your application on any x86_64 machine, it does not have to be done on the target cloud instances.

To generate a cloud feature vector, utilize the Cloud Trace Engine. This should be done on the cloud instance(s) you are interested in.

### The PERF Engine

One way to use the engine is to measure the features of your application:

```
$ cd a2cloud/perf_engine
$ ./afm.py measure MY_APP ~/codes/my_app arg1 arg2 argN
```

This will output a JSON file with the raw information. To view this information in a friendly way you can use the PERF engine's report feature:

```
$ ./afm.py report MY_APP_03122018.json
```

### The Cloud Trace Engine

To use this engine to measure the features of a cloud instance:

```
$ cd a2cloud/cloud_trace_engine
$ make
$ ./a2cloud-bench.sh # requires superuser
```

## Data Available

The `data` folder contains application and cloud vectors which have been collected so far. Application vectors can be explored easily using the PERF engine report feature:

```
$ ./afm.py report a2cloud/data/vectors/applications/**/*.json
